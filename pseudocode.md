Fourth Week Blog Post Questions:

Something I want to do that I currently don't have the skillset for is to create an app, most likely a game as I feel like making that would be more interesting for me. I remember making a little game that you could play in my highschool Comp Sci class years ago. I really look forward to when I can begin creating things that work and work well.

So, the second week hasn't been that hard for me. I'm currently just cruising along. I know that will most likely change next week, But I hope it doesn't.

I solve a problem by first, going over it, seeing if there are any errors that I missed. If that doesn't work I look it up. Then if I have trouble finding the solution by myself, I will ask for help, from someone I know can help me figure it out, my peers or the instructors. Although, so far, I haven't had any large problem.

I find it interesting that all these different languages have been created just to help people focus on each aspect of creating a program when coding. I honestly, didn't even think of the use of JavaScript when making webpages. To me, that doesn't seem like something you'd normally need. But then, seeing how it is used, it's just an Aha! kind of thing. 

So, this week, I'm actually having a pretty hard time. It started on Saturday. I was tired, and my throat was sore.  I put it down to drainage from my allergies. On Sunday, I felt terrible, my throat was killing me, I couldn't even swallow or keep down water. I had no energy and I slept on and off all day. I got absolutely nothing done. I developed sinus congestion. I took allergy medications and sudafed, but it did not help at all. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but it kept them fro getting worse (the symptoms) for about 30 minutes. Then it got steadily worse throughout the day. I tried to book an appointemnt to get tested for covid, but then I fell asleep right when I was filling it out. The next day I tried to work, I got some work on this blog done, but not very much. I did try to get the Learn done but that wasn't to be. Then Monday, I couldn't get a test as the website wouldn't allow anything earlier than Tuesday. I realized Tuesday that it was because of Labor Day, and not that they were all booked up. But because of this I fell behind. Not too far, as I started improving on Wednesday and even more on Thursday. But far enough that I was scrambling. That's only one of the challenges I've faced recently. 

My Grandmother is in hospice, and though she has made it further than anyone thought (almost 6 months longer than they gave her at the beginning), she needs someone to be with her at all times as she is growing increasingly weaker. My father is unable to stay with her all the time, and so I go down and stay with her some nights. She often gets up throughout the night and morning, so it leaves me tired some days, which impedes my ability to work. I do try and spend time working while down there, but it is often sporadic. Even with these challenges, I make good progress when I am able to sit down and whittle away at it. I have begun catching up, although I don't know if I'll be able to get the alarm clock project done by Demo Day.


Currently in my blog, I am focused on content more than setup and design. I'll do more when I have time to get around to it. But some things I have in my blog are lists, headers, the details/summary attribute to create a dropdown of my posts.

I didn't really put a lot of thought into pseudocoding before. But I recently realized it's actually very useful, and not that difficult if you know how to do it, and what you're doing.
