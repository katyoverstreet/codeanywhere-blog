## Welcome to My Web Development Journey!

:sparkles:This is my first blog post!:sparkles:

### My First Week
My first week was, in some ways, different from what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be a little more hectic, but it feels like it flew by. I did enjoy some of the new tools they have brought in, like Grasshopper. It is very thorough with the material it covers.

### Looking Forward
I am interested to get further into the javascript. I feel like the logic involved in that is something I enjoy. I'm a little more nervous about the CSS and designing aspect involved in web development.

### My Blog
I want my blog to showcase my journey through learning web developement as I fail and succeed. Everyone who reads this blog will be following along with me as I learn what to do to become a successful developer.
