## Welcome to My Web Development Journey!

:sparkles:This is my first blog post!:sparkles:

### My First Week
My first week was, in some ways, different from what I was expecting. I felt like parts of it were easier than I thought they would be, but other parts were harder to learn, or more complicated. I did enjoy some of the new tools they have brought in, like Grasshopper. It is very thorough with the material it covers.

### Looking Forward
I am interested to get further into the javascript. I feel like the logic involved in that is something I enjoy. I'm not as thrilled about the CSS and designing of webpages as I am about designing applications.
