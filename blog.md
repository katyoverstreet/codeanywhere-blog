## Welcome to My Web Development Journey!


*Hello! My name is Katy! Welcome to my Web Developer journey! This blog will be following me as I make my way through the Awesome Inc Web Development Bootcamp! The first week is a lot of reading and prework to prepare.*

*Let me tell you a bit about myself. I am 20 years old, my favourite food is probably.........*


:sparkles:This is my first blog post!:sparkles:
<br/>

### My First Week
My first week was, in some ways, different from what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be a little more hectic, but it feels like it flew by. I did enjoy some of the new tools they have brought in, like Grasshopper. It is very thorough with the material it covers.
<br/>

### Looking Forward
I am interested to get further into the javascript. I feel like the logic involved in that is something I enjoy. I'm a little more nervous about the CSS and designing aspect involved in web development.
<br/>

### My Blog
I want my blog to showcase my journey through learning web developement as I fail and succeed. Everyone who reads this blog will be following along with me as I learn what to do to become a successful developer.
