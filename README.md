# Blog on CodeAnywhere

This is the README file for my blog project

First Week Blog Post Questions:
1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?


Second Week Blog Post Questions:
1. What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
2. What are you struggling with?
3. How do you solve a problem? What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?


Third Week Blog Post Questions:
1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
2. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
3. What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?


Fourth Week Blog Post Questions:




Description
Create a markdown file that helps you document your journey through the bootcamp by answering questions and creating posts.
For this project, you will be documenting your journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer every week.
MVP
By default, your blog should be able to be viewed online by others. This Blog will be hosted on GitHub, and this repo will eventually become your full-stack portfolio.
Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
Tech Stack
1. Markdown
Process
Setup
1. Plan out and pseudocode your project
2. Create GitHub repo (either online or locally) using your username: my_user_name.github.io
3. Create necessary files for the application in your terminal and view and modify them in your editor
4. Save all and create your first commit to main, then switch to a dev branch
Application File Structure
repo/
    blog.md - file where you will be storing your blog posts
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    README.md - any important information
    pseudocode.md - any pseudocode
    .gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.
It is okay if your project has more files and directories, but you at least need the ones listed above.
Develop
1. Use a 'git-flow strategy' for updating your blog:
    1. Create a dev branch to commit your changes
    2. Add content and elements to your repo
    3. View changes and test locally
    4. Save often, and commit to your dev branch on GitHub when important changes happen
2. Push your commits to GitHub
    1. git add -A
    2. git commit -m "new commit message" 
    3. git push origin dev
Deploy
1. When you are ready to update your blog with a deployment:
    1. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
    2. Create a Pull Request from dev into main
2. Post a link from GitHub to your blog markdown file to the #operations Slack channel
Requirements
To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:
1. Create and Add continuous weekly updates to your portfolio throughout the bootcamp
2. Develop a git-flow strategy as this repo becomes your portfolio (it will be the largest and longest-lasting project during the bootcamp, so it is important that you maintain it well)
3. Write weekly Blog Posts based on the assigned prompts (Estimated time effort of 30 minutes to one hour)
4. Write periodical Technical Articles for your portfolio (Estimated time effort of two to six hours)
We will be learning design and bootstrap soon, so do not worry about your blog looking ugly just yet; you will have many opportunities to refactor
